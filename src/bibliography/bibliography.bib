	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that 
 can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL  is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},
